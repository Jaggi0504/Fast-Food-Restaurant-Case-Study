I was given a case study where I had to work on the data of a fast food restaurant and figure out the following:
1. Why is the business not maximizing the profit?
2. What recommendations I can make to increase the profitability?
3. What would be the projected profit after implementing those recommendations?

I worked on jupyter notebook and used Python for data analysis and creating graphs like Pie Chart, Bar Chart to find out:
1. Orders and sales contribution by different SKUs
2. Sales and profit contributions by different SKUs
3. Busiest hours and day of the week.

I worked on MS Excel and later on created a dashboard in Power BI.
